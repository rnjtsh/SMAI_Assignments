This folder contains the implementation of L-Layer neural networks 
and forward pass of convolutional neural networks (LeNet-5) in python without using any deep learning libraries.
Full version of CNN has been implemented using TensorFlow.
The neural network has been tested on two datsets - Deramtology dataset and Pendigit dataset.
The structure of the code has been followed from the Prof. Andrew Ng's deeplearning specialization course's assignments.
