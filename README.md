# Linear Classifiers
Classifiers are built for linearly separable datasets. 
The classifiers are built using perceptron model (Vanilla and Voted), least square method and Fisher's LDA.
Implementation of Latent semantic analysis has been done in two approaches, one is using one-vs-rest voted perceptron model
and other is based one measuring cosine similarity.
